Holiday time ... ?

* **When?** Wednesday (21. December), 17:15 - open end
* **Where?** [realraum](https://realraum.at) ([Brockmangasse 15, 8010 Graz](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/668061696#map=16/47.0656/15.4506))
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)

Please notice:

* This week, we will [meet in realraum](https://grical.realraum.at/e/show/880/), Graz' Hackspace.
* Also, we will meet a bit earlier, but feel free to show up later if
you want.


### Roadmap:

Since everyone is already in holiday mode, we are planning to have a
more relaxed session.

One idea is to recap the year and maybe look at the best challenges we
solved (or did not solve). Probably someone(tm) is going to discuss
the [last weekend](https://ctftime.org/event/370), too ...

Another idea is to look at the [Metasploitable3 CTF](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2016/12/07/metasploitable3-capture-the-flags-competition), in case
someone is motivated to build the [Metasploitable3 image](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3/) before
Wednesday ...

And there will be Glühwein, Beer, Mate, Makava, Tschunk, ... and maybe
cookies, if you bring some!
(Also I heard rumors about cooking sausages or one more pizza challenge ...)

So the main point of this meeting is socializing and celebrating a fun
& intense year.

0. Organizational Matters <br>
