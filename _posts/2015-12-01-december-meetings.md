November was a rather awesome & successful month for LosFuzzys, our CTF team. We participated in two CTFs and we did well:

* RuCTFe: place 22 out of 140 active teams
* 9447ctf: place 24 out of 595 active teams

to recap on these two CTFs (and to celebrate a bit?) we plan to organize a meeting next week (on Tuesday, December the 8th) at IAIK.
This meeting will be used to review solved challenges, present some writeups and to reflect on our strengths and weaknesses.

Also a good starting point for those new to CTF!
