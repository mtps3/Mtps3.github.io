Another week, another training, another opportunity to dig deep.

* **When?** Wednesday (1. February), 18:15 - 20:30
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a, IFEG042 (meeting room, ground floor)
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)

This week we will primarily focus on cryptography by looking at symmetric & asymmetric ciphers.
Bring your own challenge(s) as well, if you like ;)


### Roadmap:

0. Organizational Matters (Logo, ...)
1. Crypto Training Hacklets
2. If time is left, making an open session where everybody can hack on whatever they want; e.g. solving challenges from other CTFs or wargames.
(Taking a break when we need one.)

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
