Another week, another training session!
Last training in September. ;)

* **When?** Thursday (29. September), 18:00 - 21:00 (of course you can drop by later, leave earlier, or stay longer ;)
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a (seminarroom, IFEG042)
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)


**Goal?** To round out `Jeopardy September`, we will take a look at Forensic challenges. Secret data can be hidden or modulated in images, wav, pdf, zip, exe, network dumps, disk dumps, etc. - also called steganography. How to discover it?


### Roadmap:

0. Organizational stuff
1. Foreniscs with *chille*: We will start with some easy challenges from HackyEaster, hackthissite.org, hackvent and then continue with more difficult ones
2. If time is left, open h4xx0r session, or socialize
(Taking a break when we need one.)

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
