3rd edition in our new series of regular trainings!

* **When?** Thursday (15. September), 18:00 - 21:00 (of course you can drop by later, leave earlier, or stay longer ;)
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a (meet up at IFEG064 (project room, ground floor); depending on how many will come, we will go to the meeting or seminar room)
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)


**Goal?** Taking a closer look at cryptography; since it's one of the essential skills for every CTF so far. For instance where from the *ASIS CTF 9* of 30 challenges were tagged as crypto.

### Roadmap:

1. Shortly organizational stuff
2. It's planned that 2 Fuzzys guide us through crypto challenges/hacklets :)
3. If time is left, making an open session where everybody can hack on whatever they want; e.g. solving challenges from other CTFs or wargames.
(Taking a break when we need one)

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
