Part 2 of last weeks Reversing Training!

* **When?** Wednesday (30. Noember), 18:15 - 20:00 (c.t.)
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a, IFEG074 (meeting room, ground floor)
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)


Last week *wolvg* gave us a binary called *ReverseMe*. We will look into that in more detail. 

Then, if enough time is left, we would like to look at one of YOUR hacklet(s). Have you found/seen/created an interesting challenge in the last time? Great! Bring it to the training and let us h4xx0r it together! ([SASE](https://teaching.iaik.tugraz.at/sase/start) hacklets are excluded.)


### Roadmap:

  a. Christmas Celebration Reminder
1. Reversing all the things #2 with wolvg
2. (BYOC: Bring Your Own Challenge)


If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
