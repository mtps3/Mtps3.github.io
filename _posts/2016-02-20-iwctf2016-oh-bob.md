## Write-up

This crypto challenge is about breaking an RSA encryption.

As we got 3 ciphertexts for Bob, our first thought was that we could maybe apply
the Chinese Remainder Theorem. But after the extraction of the public modulus
and exponent it was clear that this would not work, because the public exponent
is ***65537***. First, taking the ***65537-th root*** is computationally expensive.
Second, we would need more encrypted messages; so that the ciphertext would not get
reduced by ***mod n_1\*n_2\*...\*n_m***. Third, we would need ciphertexts of the
same plaintext, which - what we later found out - is not the case.

Next we tried to factorize the given modulus with sage:

```python
sage: factor(0xD564B978F9D233504958EED8B744373281ED1418B29F1ECFA8093D8CF)
17963604736595708916714953362445519 * 20016431322579245244930631426505729

sage: factor(0x0A23370E7D0FB00232164AC6D642840FC54E9202433F927A60EB5ADBD9)
16514150337068782027309734859141427 * 16549930833331357120312254608496323

sage: factor(0x0C5B69E1979E541F85DACDE2AA14D2722A846F41B3DB83E667E3B3D11D)
17357677172158834256725194757225793 * 19193025210159847056853811703017693
```

Voilà! After about 3 minutes we got the factors of the modulus :)
From now on it was a straight forward task:

1. Calculate the private keys
2. Decrypt the ciphertexts
3. Decode the result

But there was one little obstacle left. After running our solution
approch we got this:

```
m1: ����I�~�z���گ8�IW{WEAK_R
m2: BZ�������%�t=L��8��
����
m3:
    S9�㑢t	8�H��pn������a4�
```

The first message looks good. What about the other 2? We exchanged
the second and third ciphertext and got this:

```
m1: ����I�~�z���گ8�IW{WEAK_R
m2: �ǌ�a��Nyj��VaSA_K3YS_4R
m3: o�ba5�����3_SO_BAD!}

```

=> flag: ***IW{WEAK_RSA_K3YS_4R3_SO_BAD!}*** :)

## Solution in sage

```python
n1 = 0xD564B978F9D233504958EED8B744373281ED1418B29F1ECFA8093D8CF

q2 = list(factors2)[1][0]

factors3 = factor(n3)
p3 = list(factors3)[0][0]
q3 = list(factors3)[1][0]

if p1*q1 == n1 and p3*q3 == n3 and p2*q2 == n2:
    print 'ps and qs seem to be correct :)'
else:
    print 'damn it...factors are not correct!'
    exit(1)

phi1 = (p1 - 1) * (q1 -1)
phi2 = (p2 - 1) * (q2 -1)
phi3 = (p3 - 1) * (q3 -1)

bezout1 = xgcd(e, phi1)
bezout2 = xgcd(e, phi2)
bezout3 = xgcd(e, phi3)

d1 = Integer(mod(bezout1[1], phi1))
d2 = Integer(mod(bezout2[1], phi2))
d3 = Integer(mod(bezout3[1], phi3))

print 'd1: ' + str(d1)
print 'd2: ' + str(d2)
print 'd3: ' + str(d3)

if mod(d1*e,phi1) != 1 or mod(d1*e,phi1) != 1 or mod(d1*e,phi1) != 1:
    print 'one of the inverse is wrong!!'
    exit(1)

m1 = power_mod(c1,d1,n1)
m2 = power_mod(c2,d2,n2)
m3 = power_mod(c3,d3,n3)

print 'm1: ' + ('0' + str(hex(m1))).decode('hex')
print 'm2: ' + ('0' + str(hex(m2))).decode('hex')
print 'm3: ' + ('0' + str(hex(m3))).decode('hex')
```
