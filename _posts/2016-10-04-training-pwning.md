As already announced in the last training session, our new training date during the winter semester is Wednesday from 18:15 c.t. to 20:30.
We are, if not otherwise announced, located in IAIK's seminar room (IFEG042).

The next training: *Step up your game and start pwning with f0rki*

* **When?** Wednesday (4. October), 18:15 - 20:30
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a, IFEG042 (seminar room, ground floor)
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)


### Roadmap:

0. Organizational Matters
1. Very interactive pwning session, in where we will try to pwn the provided challenges :)
2. If time is left, making an open session where everybody can hack on whatever they want; e.g. solving challenges from other CTFs or wargames.
(Taking a break when we need one.)

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
