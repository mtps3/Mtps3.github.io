2nd edition in our new series of regular trainings!

* **When?** Thursday (8. September), 18:00 - 21:00 (of course you can drop by later, leave earlier, or stay longer ;)
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a (meet up at IFEG064 (project room, ground floor); depending on how many will come, we will go to the meeting or seminar room)
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)


**Goal?** Taking a closer look at web security. First, it's planned that 3 Fuzzys guide us through 3 web hacklets. Then, like last time, taking a short break, and after that making an open session where everybody can hack on whatever they want.
