FaustCTF, another offence&defence CTF, is happening on the 18th of December (Friday before the Christmas break) and we are going to participate!

For that we scheduled two events:

> [FaustCTF preparation meeting](https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/!wbTermin.wbEdit?pTerminNr=6034409) (+ $tool workshop?)
> Thu 2015-12-17, 17:00 to 20:00

> [FaustCTF](https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/!wbTermin.wbEdit?pTerminNr=6034411)
> Fri 2015-12-18, 10:00 to ~00:10
> (FaustCTF itself will start at 16:00, so feel free to arrive at ~15:00 (or even later))

Both will happen in the [IAIK seminar-room](https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/ris.ris?pOrgNr=983&pQuellGeogrBTypNr=5&pZielGeogrBTypNr=5&pZielGeogrBerNr=3020009&pRaumNr=4844&pActionFlag=A&pShowEinzelraum=J) (so not the meeting-room).

### After-Chillout

We may or may not chill in [realraum](https://wp.realraum.at/) after FaustCTF (which ends at ~01:00 (we think)). [Be invited!](https://grical.realraum.at/e/show/717/)

**IMPORTANT:**
All our meetings are open to everyone, so if you are not part of LosFuzzys, feel free to come anyway. And if you know some people interested in what we do, please invite them. :-)
