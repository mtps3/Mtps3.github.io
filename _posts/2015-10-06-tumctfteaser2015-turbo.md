## Write-up


This was a fun challenge. Again the service is written in python. This services seems
to involve two secrets we don't know. We can send a password and a command, if the
password is correct it will be executed. The flag and the output are then encrypted
with AES-CBC and an unkown key.

```python

#!/usr/bin/env python3
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import binascii, gzip, subprocess

try:
    pw, cmd = input().split(' ', 1)
except ValueError:
    exit(1)

goodpw = open('password.txt', 'r').read().strip()
assert len(goodpw) >= 32

key = open('key.bin', 'rb').read()
assert len(key) in AES.key_size
iv = open('/dev/urandom', 'rb').read(AES.block_size)
assert len(iv) == AES.block_size
aes = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)

flag = open('flag.txt', 'r').read().strip()

r = b''
r += 'Today\'s special: {}.\n'.format(flag).encode()
if pw == goodpw:
    r += subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell = True)
else:
    r += 'Wrong password: {}.\n'.format(pw).encode()

padded = gzip.compress(r)
padded += bytes([AES.block_size - len(padded) % AES.block_size or AES.block_size])
padded += b'\0' * (AES.block_size - len(padded) % AES.block_size)

print(binascii.hexlify(iv + aes.encrypt(padded)).decode())
```

The password is at least 32 bytes long, so too long to guess. But if we take a closer
look at the code, we see that the data is compressed before it is encrypted. Furthermore
we control parts of the output, because the password is added to the encrypted data.
We can use the service as an oracle, by abusing the compression. Remember
[CRIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME) and
[BREACH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BREACH_%28security_exploit%29)?

So the way this attack works is that we will guess the flag byte by byte and supply
our guess of the flag as the password. The flag is already in the data that is
compressed. If we guessed the flag correctly the compression will remove this
redundant data and we will see no increase in length. If we guessed wrong we will
see longer data. The tricky part here is that we won't see a change in length if
the bytes we are guessing are not at the "boundary" of a cipher block. But this
is relatively easy to achieve by gradually filling the supplied data with random
characters, that probably won't be compressed, until we see a length change.

One thing that puzzeled me while playing around is that there is a bug in the padding
code. If you have zero bytes of padding you will get an additional ciphertext block,
filled with `0x01` bytes. Fortunately this doesn't matter much for the attack, we just
have to make sure that there is always 2 bytes padding in the last block.

In this case we know that the flags start with `hxp{`. So we can start by checking
whether this increases the length of ciphertext. Of course we have to account for
the bytes that the backreference that is added by gzip needs. As expected it
didn't increase the length, so we are on a good track. Now we have to guess
the following bytes, of which we can assume they are printable. So we start
by supplying `hxp{a`, `hxp{b` etc. until we receive a ciphertext that has
the same length as only `hxp{`. Then we have guessed correct and we can continue
with the next byte: `hxp{1a`, `hxp{1b` etc.

I wrote the following script, which will guess the flag byte by byte using the
oracle. Unfortunately I didn't manage to complete the script in time and it
finished guessing only a few minutes after the CTF ended. The service was still
up so I got the flag `hxp{1_r34LLy_L1k3_0r4cL3s__n0T_7h3_c0mp4nY}`

# We can find out how long the flag is by gradually increasing the length of

# empty password. We can then calculate the length of the flag by subtracting
# the length of the padding and the other known plaintext. The only thing
# that's left must be the length of the flag. At least that's the idea. For
# some reason (I guess gzip) this isn't working so well...
