Another week, another training session!

*[A wild binary appears!](https://www.slideshare.net/stefan2904/a-ctf-hackers-toolbox-61520370/21) What to do next? Hacker uses reverse engineering ... Itâ€™s super effective!*

* **When?** Thursday (22. September), 18:00 - 21:00 (of course you can drop by later, leave earlier, or stay longer ;)
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a (meet up at IFEG064 (project room, ground floor); depending on how many will come, we will go to the meeting or seminar room)
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)


**Goal?** Taking a closer look at [Angr](http://angr.io/) & [Radare](http://rada.re/r/); since [reversing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering) is also one of the essential skills for every CTF. 


### Roadmap:

1. Reversing with [f0rki](https://twitter.com/f0rki): live hacking using Angr & Radare. (we might start with a quick setup session.)
2. If time is left, making an open session where everybody can hack on whatever they want; e.g. solving challenges from other CTFs or wargames.
(Taking a break when we need one.)

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
