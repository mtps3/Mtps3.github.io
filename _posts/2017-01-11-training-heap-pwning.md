This Wednesday we're gonna take a look at a couple of challenges regarding heap exploitation. So *git pull* your *radare2*. ;)

* **When?** Wednesday (11. January), 18:15 - 20:30
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a, IFEG042 (seminar room, ground floor)
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)

If you're not so familiar with binary exploitation yet, there will also be a easy challenge. :)


### Roadmap:

0. Organizational Matters
1. Heap pwning session wit fßrki
2. If time is left, making an open session where everybody can hack on whatever they want; e.g. solving challenges from other CTFs or wargames.
(Taking a break when we need one.)

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
