## Write-up

This crypto challenge is about proof of work and signatures.

At first we need to solve a proof of work challenge.
The server sends 9 random bytes, base64 encoded.
The challenge is to find an input which has a length of 20 bytes and starts with the 12 base64 encoded random bytes from the server
for the SHA-1 hash algorithm that results in an output value with 3 ***\x00*** in the end.
This was a straight forward task: appending characters to the challenge in a loop until we find a hash which fulfills our criteria.

Now the tricky part begins.
The server generates 2 times 128 random bytes, ***SECRET*** and ***TO_SIGN***.
The signature is then calculated as follows: ***sig = sign(SECRET + TO_SIGN)***.
The server sends us ***TO_SIGN*** and we need to find a collision.
This means that we need to find another input, which gets concatenated with ***SECRET***, that results in the same signature.
Before we provide our input, we can send the server values which are different to ***TO_SIGN***, lets call them ***TO_SIGN'***, and the server responds with the signature (***sig = sign(SECRET + TO_SIGN')***).
For each connection we can ask the server for at most 255 signatures.

To solve also this challenge, we needed to take a closer look at the signature algorithm.
It's the product of each cycle length of the input (***SECRET + value***).
The cycle length can also be thought as the amount of edges in a graph.
For instance you start at index 0, which is your first node, and jump to the index which is the value at index 0.
Now you would have a cycle length of 1.
This process continues until you get an index which is already in the graph.

We came up with 2 solutions.

One is that we searched for a circle inside ***TO_SIGN*** and changed the orientation (each node points then to the incoming node).
For example if you have the circle ***7-->10-->8-->7***, you can change its orientation to ***7-->8-->10-->7***.
This is a different input for the signature algorithm, but leads to the same signature as we are challenged on :)
One remark here is that we came up with this solution when the CTF was already over.

One is that we changed exactly 1 byte in ***TO_SIGN*** (to the value of the current index), let the server sign the modified value, and store the signature in a map.
The key of this map is the signature, and the value is the occurrence of this signature.
After 128 iterations (length of ***TO_SIGN***) we take the signature which occurred most often, and this was in almost every case the same signature as we are challenged on :)
This is the solution we used during the CTF.

## Solution in python

The second solution, what we used during the CTF, can be found in the outcommented part in the main function.
