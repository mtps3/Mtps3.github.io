Another training in between our exploitation and reversing series.

* **When?** Wednesday (14. December), 18:15 - 20:00 (c.t.)
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a, IFEG074 (meeting room, ground floor)
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)


In the last time it was quite common in CTF competitions,that a challenge was part of 2 categories. For instance "binary/crypto" or "web/crypto" in the last one (SECCON). Hence, f0rki created a nice challenge which combines aspects of web & crypto. ;)

Then as last time, if enough time is left, we would like to look at one of YOUR hacklet(s). Have you found/seen/created an interesting challenge in the last time? Great! Bring it to the training and let us h4xx0r it together!


### Roadmap:

0. Organizational Matters <br> 
  a. PLEASE actively use our CTF Pad during Competitions <br> 
  b. Just 2 More CTF Sessions 
1. web/crypto with f0rki (:
2. (BYOC: Bring Your Own Challenge)


If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
