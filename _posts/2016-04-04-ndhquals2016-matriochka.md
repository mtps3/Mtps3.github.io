# Write-up

So we started of with a binary and a vague description. We could see that there
are 4 challenges in the scoreboard, which are all called Matriochka. We are not
given a binary for the stages 3-4. As it turns out, each of the stages printed
the next stage, when given the right password as command line argument.

## Stage 1

This one was pretty easy: strings. My colleagues already solved this one when I
started playing.

```
[0x00400560]> iz
[...]
vaddr=0x0040e062 paddr=0x0000e062 ordinal=4719 sz=23 len=22 section=.rodata type=ascii string=2$^HxUsage: %s <pass>\n
vaddr=0x0040e079 paddr=0x0000e079 ordinal=4720 sz=26 len=25 section=.rodata type=ascii string=Much_secure__So_safe__Wow
vaddr=0x0040e093 paddr=0x0000e093 ordinal=4721 sz=12 len=11 section=.rodata type=ascii string=Good good!\n
vaddr=0x0040e09f paddr=0x0000e09f ordinal=4722 sz=14 len=13 section=.rodata type=ascii string=Try again...\n
```

There were a lot of other weird strings, probably the next stage.

So let's try `Much_secure__So_safe__Wow`.

```
./stage1.bin Much_secure__So_safe__Wow 2>./stage1_out.base64
Good good!
```

On stderr we get some base64 encoded data, which turns out to be the next
stage.

```
$ cat ./stage1_out.base64 | base64 -d | tar x
$ file stage2.bin
stage2.bin: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=7b2fd52d0de50c9e575793a0fd17fdd2574c5c53, stripped
```

## Stage 2

Stage 2 again validates a password. If we look at the Control Flow Graph of the
main function (using radare `VV` and zooming out)

```
                        <@@@@@@>
                           t f

            |     |    |     |
           [_078b_]    |     |


[...]

      [_093e_]   |     |     |
       v         |     |     |
       '----.    '.    |     |
            |     |    |     |
            |     |    |     |
           [_0945_]    |     |
                f t    |     |
           .----'.'    |     |
           |     |     |     |
           |     |     |     |
      [_0978_]   |     |     |
       v         |     |     |
       '----.    '.    |     |
            |     |    |     |
            |     |    |     |
           [_097f_]    |     |
                f t    |     |
         .------' '--. '-.   |
         |           |   |   |
         |           |   |   |
    [_0985_]      [_099a_]   |
     v             v         |
     '-----------.-----------'
                 |
                 |
                [_09b3_]
```

We can see a very clear pattern. If we take a look at the first part

```
[0x0040076b 5% 230 stage2.bin]> pd $r @ main+121 # 0x40076b
│           0x0040076b      c745ec010000.  mov dword [rbp - local_14h], 1
│           0x00400772      488b45d0       mov rax, qword [rbp - local_30h]
│           0x00400776      4883c008       add rax, 8
│           0x0040077a      488b00         mov rax, qword [rax]
│           0x0040077d      0fb600         movzx eax, byte [rax]
│           0x00400780      3c50           cmp al, 0x50                ; 'P'
│       ┌─< 0x00400782      7407           je 0x40078b                 ;[1]
│       │   0x00400784      c745ec000000.  mov dword [rbp - local_14h], 0
│       │   ; JMP XREF from 0x00400782 (main)
│       └─> 0x0040078b      488b45d0       mov rax, qword [rbp - local_30h]
[...]
```

Basically here the first byte of the passed argument is checked and if it isn't
equal to `P` then 0 is written to `[rbp - local_14h]`. At the end of the
program if this is 1, the password is validated.

So I reversed the first three characters of the password, but then it got
annoying. There must be a better. Now I always wanted to try
[angr](http://angr.io) , a symbolic/concolic execution framework by the
shellphish guys. I never used it so I read some examples and quickly whipped up
a script to solve this challenge:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import angr
import claripy


def long_to_str(l):
    """We get the bitvector as a python long and we need to convert it"""
    x = []
    while l != 0:
        x.append(chr(l & 0xff))
        l = l >> 8
    return "".join(x)[::-1]


p = angr.Project("./stage2.bin")

# avoid the BBs that do
# mov dword [rbp - local_14h], 0
avoids = [0x400784,
          0x4007a9,
          0x4007e0,
          0x400826,
          0x400855,
          0x400884,
          0x4008b8,
          0x4008e7,
          0x400904,
          0x40093e,
          0x400978,
          ]
# target the write block
target = 0x00400993

# found through manual reversing
flaglen = 11 * 8  # in bits

# the flag is the only symbolic input
flagsym = claripy.BVS('arg1', flaglen)
# create the memory state of the program
state = p.factory.entry_state(args=['./stage2.bin', flagsym])
path = p.factory.path(state)

# launch the Explorer. angr will try to find a execution path from the
# entrypoint to the target address (the stage3 printing), while avoiding
# the basicblocks that set the found bool to 0.
# This should gather enough constraints on the symbolic flag, that there is
# only one possible input to trigger that path.
ex = p.surveyors.Explorer(find=(target, ), avoid=avoids, start=path)
ex.run()

if len(ex.found) > 0:
    #print "Found path:", ex.found[0]

    for flag in ex.found[0].state.se.any_n_int(flagsym, flaglen):
        print "possible flag:"
        print flag
        print long_to_str(flag)
else:
    print "Nothing found :("
```

Let's see the output:

```
$ python solve_stage2_angr.py
possible flag:
97174171495276010235913313
Pandi_panda

$ ./stage2.bin Pandi_panda 2>stage2_out.base64
Good good!

$ cat ./stage2_out.base64 | base64 -d > stage3.bin
```

done :)

## Stage 3

This is a very interesting binary. Instead of using normal calls, the binary
uses signal handlers to perform control transfers.

```
[0x0040114b 23% 230 stage3.bin]> pd $r @ main+90 # 0x40114b
│           0x0040114b      befd074000     mov esi, sub.signal_7fd     ; "UH..H.. .}.....8 " @ 0x4007fd
│           0x00401150      bf0b000000     mov edi, 0xb
│           0x00401155      e866f5ffff     call sym.imp.signal         ;[3]
│           0x0040115a      be50104000     mov esi, sub.fwrite_50      ; "UH..H.. .}.H..>0 " @ 0x401050
│           0x0040115f      bf08000000     mov edi, 8
│           0x00401164      e857f5ffff     call sym.imp.signal         ;[3]
```

If we look at the first signal handler, we can see that it registers another
signal handler.

```
[0x00400836 11% 230 stage3.bin]> pd $r @ sub.signal_7fd+57 # 0x400836
│           0x00400836      817dfce70300.  cmp dword [rbp - local_4h], 0x3e7 ; [0x3e7:4]=0
│       ┌─< 0x0040083d      7e09           jle 0x400848                ;[1]
│       │   0x0040083f      817dfce80300.  cmp dword [rbp - local_4h], 0x3e8 ; [0x3e8:4]=0
│      ┌──< 0x00400846      7e02           jle 0x40084a                ;[2]
│      ││   ; JMP XREF from 0x0040083d (sub.signal_7fd)
│     ┌─└─> 0x00400848      eb10           jmp 0x40085a                ;[3]
│     ││    ; JMP XREF from 0x00400846 (sub.signal_7fd)
│     │└──> 0x0040084a      be5c084000     mov esi, sub.signal_85c     ; "UH..H.. .}..E." @ 0x40085c
│     │     0x0040084f      bf0b000000     mov edi, 0xb
│     │     0x00400854      e867feffff     call sym.imp.signal         ;[4]
```

In total there are 22 signal handlers, which register the next signal handler
on success.

```
> afl~signal_ | wc -l
21
```

`fcn.0040100e` is the last signal handler, which doesn't register another
signal handler. I don't know why radare didn't rename this one. So we can
assume that the password will be 22 bytes long, since every signal handlers
seems to check exactly one byte.

Using angr again is probably gonna take a
little work. Just launching an Explorer like in the previous example results
in some error, that a syscall is not implemented. I assume it's the signaling.
We could somehow patch the binary, or hook the signal calls. After some
brainstorming with a colleague, we thought that there might be some
"side-channel", we can use the bruteforce the flag byte by byte. So I
experimented with `strace` a little. The first thing I noticed is that there
are always 1023 calls to `kill`, triggering a segfault. We can confirm this
using radare, that this happens in the main function.

```
$ strace ./stage3.bin asdf 2>&1 | grep kill | wc -l
1024
```

We can also get the number of registered signals using `strace`:

```
$ strace ./stage3.bin asdf 2>&1 | grep sigaction | wc -l
2
```

These are the two calls to signal in the `main` function. If we guess a
character right we should see one more call to `signal`. So I whipped up a
quick shell three-liner:

```
$ for x in A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 '{' '}' '!' '@' '#' '$' '%' '^' '&' '*' '(' ')' '-' '-' '_' '+' '=' '[' ']' '.' ';' '\\' '/' ',' '<' '>' '`' '~' "'" '"' '?'; do
echo "= $x ="; strace ./stage3.bin "$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x$x" 2>&1 | grep sigaction | wc -l
done > log; cat log | grep -B 1 "$(cat log | grep -v = | sort | uniq | tail -n 1)"


= D =
3
--
2
= 3 =
```

So we got the first character. I replaced the first `$x` with `D` and on to the
next character.

```
for x in A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 '{' '}' '!' '@' '#' '$' '%' '^' '&' '*' '(' ')' '-' '-' '_' '+' '=' '[' ']' '.' ';' '\\' '/' ',' '<' '>' '`' '~' "'" '"' '?'; do
echo "= $x ="; strace ./stage3.bin "Did_you_like_signals$x" 2>&1 | grep sigaction | wc -l
done > log; cat log | grep -B 1 "$(cat log | grep -v = | sort | uniq | tail -n 1)"

= ? =
23
```

So the flag is `Did_you_like_signals?`. I feel dirty now.


```
$ ./stage3.bin 'Did_you_like_signals?' 2>stage3_out.base64

Good good! Now let's play a game...
$ cat stage3_out.base64 | base64 -d > stage4.bin
```

## Stage 4

Unfortunately time ran out, so I didn't solve the challenge in time.

```
$ file stage4.bin
stage4.bin: DOS/MBR boot sector
$ qemu-system-i386 ./stage4.bin
```

...and we are presented with the following prompt:
