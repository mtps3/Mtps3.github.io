RuCTFe Lessons Learned + Pwning Training

* **When?** Wednesday (16. Noember), 18:15 - 20:00 (c.t.)
* **Where?** @IAIK, Inffeldgasse 16a, IFEG074 (meeting room, ground floor)
* **Who?** you! (please let us know if you plan to come.)


What comes after a huge Attack-Defense CTF?
Yes, lessons learned & digging deeper. ;)

In the last jeopardy-style CTFs we have solved quite some crypto,
forensics, and web challenges, but experienced that we need
to pwn & reverse more!

On the one hand that is because these categories are in general
not so easy in the beginning, and on the other hand not so many
Fuzzys are active in this area during CTFs.
Therefore we will start now a pwning & reversing series to reduce
the hurdle of starting in these categories. ;)
(But don't worry, also the other categories will be handled sometimes
in between.)

Thus, after talking about RuCTFe, we will h4xx0r some
beginner-friendly exploitation (often also so-called pwning)
challenges provided by creed et al. :)


### Roadmap:
